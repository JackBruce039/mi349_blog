            <p>Hi, welcome to my site! </p>
            <p>My name is Jack Bruce. I'm a 22 year old college senior at Michigan State
            University. <br> I'm studying at the college of Communitcation Arts and Sciences 
            with a major in Games and <br>Interactive media and a minor in Game Design. I've 
            been a part of a few different game projects <br> while studying including; </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chain Gang</li>
                <li>Hindsight</li>
                <li>Persephone's Path</li>
                <li>Tiny Ostrich Arena</li>
                <li>Hattrick, The Magician</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I do have some other interests besides games though. I love hockey 
                especially my home team <br>(Go Bolts!). Running is a big hobby of mine. 
                I ran Track and Cross Country in High School <br> and I've been attempting 
                to stay in shape while in College. Anyway, thanks for visiting my page! </p>
