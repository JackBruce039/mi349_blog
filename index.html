            <p> When I moved into my apartment this year, one of my roommates had just made
                a genius investment. He decided to buy an air fryer. With the air fryer we
                were able to make a whole bunch of different foods that would normally need
                a grill or take a super long time in the stove. But, with the air frier we
                could make those same kinds of foods but in a fraction of the time. It was
                great for the first few months; we were making a bunch of different
                really good foods. It even came with a little cookbook that we could
                try out some preplanned recipes. But, just this week, one of my other
                roommates went to make some pork chops and bam our frier was broken. For
                some reason it would cook for a minute exactly and then shut off,
                giving us an “E1” error message. We had no idea what that meant but it 
                obviously wouldn’t work. So, now we’ve tried dissecting it to see if there 
                was anything visibly wrong, which of course there wasn’t. Next on the to-do 
                list is to call up the company to see if there’s any easy fix, but bottom
                line, we’re out an air frier.  </p>

            <h2>Why Hollow Knight is a Masterpiece</h2>

            <p> Hollow Knight is a game made by Team Cherry in 2017 that absolutely changed  
                the way I look at video games. In Hollow Knight you play as a nameless bug 
                with a sword exploring a long forgotten ruined kingdom that has become plagued 
                with a mysterious sickness. As you play you uncover more about the kingdom 
                through the few characters that are still left and primarily through the world. 
                Hollow Knight’s kingdom of Hallownest is a vast place with many different 
                areas that have been crafted to tell the story of the kingdom not through 
                dialogue but through the visuals to all those who take the time to look. 
                In addition, Hollow Knight doesn’t hold your hand while you play. It’s 
                brutally difficult at times and lets you go almost anywhere you want from 
                the get-go, only barring your exploration for certain story beats. Exploration
                is at the forefront of Hollow Knight’s gameplay. There are a slew of different
                secrets that you can find, from power ups, special abilities, to even 
                entire bosses that are left up to the player to find. Hollow Knight even
                put super secrets in various places around its world. Normal secrets are
                at least fairly noticeable to the player if they’re not ignoring 
                everything but the path in front of them. But, these special secrets are
                not even visible to the player unless they are specifically looking
                in every nook and cranny to find. This level of craftsmanship and care 
                that the developers put into Hollow Knight are why I believe it to be 
                a masterpiece.</p>
